# filecoinpython

This repo is the starting point for the Filecoin HackFS hackathon.

Our short-term goal is to merge both apps, currently named data_collector and python1website into one app 
that will be a decentralized financial data store where end-users can access real-time financial and 
asset pricing data as well as short and long-term price charts. 

After merging the apps so that the former data_collector app is now the input/output functions and also can 
provide the user with a .csv file for historical asset prices as well as a chart, we will integrate a Chainlink 
oracle into the app, which will provide the most up-to-the-minute pricing of these assets.  Filecoin integration
would be the basis of the financial data storage. Please hit us up on Slack for more info.
